# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers, we pledge to foster an open and welcoming
environment in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect. 
We are committed to ensuring that everyone, regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, has a 
harassment-free experience when participating in our project and community.

## Our Standards

We expect all community members to uphold the following standards:

Acceptable Behavior:

* Use language that is welcoming and inclusive of all people and their experiences.
* Respect opposing points of view and ideas, even if they conflict with your own.
* Engage in thoughtful, productive discussions and be open to constructive criticism.
* Concentrate on the community's collective good rather than individual goals.
* Empathize with other members of the community and encourage their growth and development.

Unacceptable Behavior:
We do not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or abusive behavior. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, making unwanted sexual advances, or engaging in other forms of sexual harassment.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal attacks, or political attacks on others that are hurtful, harmful, or disrespectful.
* Harassment in public or private, including doxing or publishing private information about others without their express permission.
* Other inappropriate or unprofessional behaviour in a community setting.

## Our Responsibilities

We are responsible as project maintainers for outlining acceptable behaviour
norms and implementing appropriate and equitable remedial action in response
to any instances of unacceptable behaviour. We have the right and obligation
to remove, amend, or reject any contributions that do not comply with this
code of conduct, as well as to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor
for other inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behaviour.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community members in all project spaces
and public spaces, including online forums and social media platforms, when
representing the project or its community. This includes using official 
project communication channels or acting as an appointed representative 
at online or offline events. Project maintainers may further define and 
clarify representation of the project as needed.

## Enforcement

We take all reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior seriously.
If you experience or witness any such behavior, please report it to the project 
team at mentorship@moja.global. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated,
and appropriate action will be taken based on the circumstances of each case. 
We will also maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of any incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this code of conduct in good faith may 
face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Additional Suggestions

In addition to the above code of conduct, we suggest the following to help create a positive and inclusive community:

* Provide examples of what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behavior in the context of the project and community.
* Encourage community members to support and amplify diverse perspectives and experiences.
* Create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all community members, regardless of their background or level of experience.
* Encourage community members to participate in open and respectful discussions, and to listen to and learn from one another.
* Regularly review and update the code of conduct to ensure that it reflects the needs and values of the community.

We hope that these guidelines will help foster a supportive and inclusive community where all members feel valued and respected
